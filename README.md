## Description of the Project
Our aim is to create "Slay The Spire" game by using the principles of object-oriented programming. We are going to implement the game using Java and JavaFX libraries.


## Description of the Game
It’s a card game. Player creates his own deck. Player's aim is to win the battle by using the features of cards that are in his deck.




Slay the Spire is a game which is based on cards and whose concept is dungeon. Expectation from the users is selecting cards from collection to do combat with monsters of game which vary 1 to 3 level. Users may obtain new cards, relics and develop their characther if they defeat monsters. To clarify what the relics are, relics are basically items with passive manner that have special ability. This special ability of relics are also has also signifcant impact on users’ gameplay. In order to defeat Slay the Spire’s bosses, users should consider effective and creative tacticts. Slay the Spire offers reward if and only if users take risk which may also cause penalty to them. In addition, game has a concept to allow users to block debuffs which named as Artifacts. Users can obtain artifacts by beating Elite Monsters of Slay the Spire. These monsters are quite powerful creatures of the game which makes them hard to defeat. Users may choose not dealing with elite monsters to preserve their health points but this will inhibit the chance of getting relics. In first glance, Slay the Spire may seen as easy to proceed, however, in an effort to master at game users needs to put considerable effort. Game has meant to allow users to apply amazing combos with their desk which requires building the most harmonious collections from varying cards. Slay the Spire also offers unexpected flow of actions in game which makes this game interesting and enjoyable.
Slay the Spire has numerous stages to be overcomed by players. Consecutive stages or phases of the game have difficulty differnces among themselves which makes this game more and more challenging to reach ultimate enemy while users proceed. Users should collect and combine potent cards to survive against monsters and diminish all of them.
